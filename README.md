HOW TO RUN:
In order to run SearchMap please include input.txt and output.txt files inside the project directory outside any sub directories. After adding those files with their appropriate information, cd into the bin folder while still being outside the package folder "Project1" run the program by typing: "java Project1.SearchMap ../input.txt ../output.txt".

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
When running the doc command, there will be warnings generated by terminal but the appropriate html files should be generated in the doc folder.
